# RFM Analysis

## Definition

RFM Analysis is a marketing strategy that segments customers based on their recent purchase behavior (Recency), frequency of purchases (Frequency), and the monetary value of those purchases (Monetization). It is commonly used to identify and target specific customer segments for personalized marketing efforts.

## Methodology

RFM Analysis involves analyzing three key aspects of customer behavior:

1. **Recency (R):** How recently did the customer make a purchase?
2. **Frequency (F):** How often does the customer make purchases?
3. **Monetization (M):** What is the monetary value of the customer's purchases?

Each customer is assigned a score for each dimension, and these scores are then used to segment customers into different groups.

## Steps

1. **Data Collection:** Gather transactional data including purchase dates, frequency, and monetary values.
2. **Scoring:** Assign scores to customers based on recency, frequency, and monetization. Higher scores often indicate better customers.
3. **Segmentation:** Group customers based on their scores. Common segments include high-value customers, loyal customers, and dormant customers.
4. **Targeting:** Tailor marketing strategies for each segment to maximize engagement and revenue.
5. **Analysis:** Continuously monitor and refine the segments based on evolving customer behavior.

## Pros

- **Targeted Marketing:** Allows for personalized marketing strategies for different customer segments.
- **Customer Retention:** Helps identify and retain high-value and loyal customers.
- **Resource Optimization:** Enables efficient allocation of resources by focusing on the most valuable customer segments.
