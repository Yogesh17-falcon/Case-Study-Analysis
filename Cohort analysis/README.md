# Cohort Analysis 

## Overview
Welcome to the Cohort Analysis project! This analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior over time through cohort analysis, specifically examining customer retention and Lifetime Value (LTV). Cohort analysis is a valuable tool for gaining insights into user behavior and making informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and revenue.

## Methodology
1. **Cohort Formation**: Cohorts are created based on the customer acquisition date, grouping users into cohorts based on the month or time period they first engaged with the product or service.

2. **Customer Retention Analysis**: The retention rate is calculated for each cohort, providing insights into how well the business is retaining customers over time.

3. **Lifetime Value Calculation**: LTV is calculated by estimating the total revenue generated by a cohort over its lifetime. This involves analyzing the purchasing behavior of customers within the cohort.
